# Case-2
Executive Summary: I was tasked to make a model which predicts the quality of wine through various variables. I was also tasked to find the mean absolute error (MAE) and describe why the chosen variables make sense to include in the model.

The chosen variables:
Fixed Acidity
Volatile Acidity
Residual Sugars
Free Sulfur Dioxide
Total Sulfur Dioxide
Sulphates
Alcohol Level
Density
pH
Location
Type of Wine (Red/White)

Through my model, an MAE of 0.5022 was achieved.

My reasonings for the inclusion of these variables are:
Fixed + Volatile Acidity: Fixed acidity is a metric of stable acids while volatile acidity is a metric of those which evaporate easily. A balance of the two is best, while too much volatile acidity can detract from quality.
Residual Sugar: Residual sugar can make a wine sweeter and balance acidity. It also indicates how fermented the wine is. Too much residual sugar can indicate an issue in fermentation.
Free and Total Sulfur Dioxide: Free sulfur dioxide protects against spoilage while total sulfur dioxide includes bound and free forms of sulfur dioxide. Excessive levels of either can lead to poor taste while too little can lead to spoilage.
Sulphates: Too many sulphates can lead to bitterness and a decrease in quality.
Alcohol: A higher alcohol content has shown to have a positive and negative impact on the quality, which makes sense because it can make a drink feel more fulfilling but too much can overpower if the rest of the drink isn't up to par.
Density: Since alcohol is less dense than water, having an increase in alcohol content is going to increase the density, so they are related. The density can also be a consequence of the sugar content.
pH: A balanced pH level can maintain flavor while a pH level that is too high or low can lead to a lower quality due to altering the flavor.
Location: Some locations are going to have better climate and soil for wine production, and the best locations are going to have higher expectations.
Type: The type of wine can have differing qualities because of their differing flavors and chemical compositions. 

I was surprised that the fixed and volatile acidities were significant enough to include but citric acid was not. I was also surprised about the trend of alcohol content and the quality of wine. I also wonder why no wine was graded with a 10/10...
